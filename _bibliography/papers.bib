  abstract = {There is growing interest in microLED devices with lateral dimensions between 1 and 10 μm. However, reductions in external quantum efficiency (EQE) due to increased nonradiative recombination at the surface become an issue at these sizes. Previous attempts to study size-dependent EQE trends have been limited to dimensions above 5 μm, partly due to fabrication challenges. Here, we present size-dependent EQE data for InGaN microLEDs down to 1 μm in diameter fabricated using a process that only utilizes standard semiconductor processing techniques (i.e., lithography and etching). Furthermore, differences in EQE trends for blue and green InGaN microLEDs are compared. Green wavelength devices prove to be less susceptible to reductions in efficiency with the decreasing size; consequently, green devices attain higher EQEs than blue devices below 10 μm despite lower internal quantum efficiencies in the bulk material. This is explained by smaller surface recombination velocities with the increasing indium content due to enhanced carrier localization.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {The electrical and optical improvements of AlGaInP micro-light-emitting diodes (µLEDs) using atomic-layer deposition (ALD) sidewall passivation were demonstrated. Due to the high surface recombination velocity and minority carrier diffusion length of the AlGaInP material system, devices without sidewall passivation suffered from high leakage and severe drop in external quantum efficiency (EQE). By employing ALD sidewall treatments, the 20×20 µm
              2
              µLEDs resulted in greater light output power, size-independent leakage current density, and lower ideality factor. The forward current-voltage characteristic was enhanced by using surface pretreatment. Furthermore, ALD sidewall treatments recovered the EQE of the 20×20 µm

              devices more than 150\%. This indicated that AlGaInP µLEDs with ALD sidewall treatments can be used as the red emitter for full-color µLED display applications.},

  abstract = {A III-nitride red LED with an active region temperature of 835 °C on a Si substrate utilizing a strain-relaxed template (SRT) is demonstrated. The peak wavelength blueshifts from 670 nm at 1 A/cm2 to 636 nm at 150 A/cm2. The on-wafer external quantum efficiency was 0.021\% at 7 A/cm2 with an emission wavelength of 655 nm. The LED grown on a Si substrate exhibited a 116 nm redshift when compared to a co-loaded LED grown on sapphire. This is attributed to the difference in strain state for the III-nitride layers grown on Si compared to sapphire, allowing for more indium to be incorporated in the LED grown on Si. This suggests efficient III-nitride red LEDs and µLEDs on Si with a SRT can be realized with further material, device structure, and processing optimizations.},

In this article, we use V-defect engineering as a technique to achieve higher efficiencies in red InGaN LEDs on (111) Si through lateral injection. We investigate the effects of superlattice structure on the V-defect distribution, the electroluminescence properties, and the external quantum efficiency. Increasing the relative thickness of In in the InGaN/GaN superlattice and the total superlattice thickness correlate with a reduction of active region defects and increased external quantum efficiencies. The highest measured on-chip EQE was 0.15\% and based on Monte-Carlo ray tracing simulations for light extraction we project this would correspond to a flip-chip EQE of {\textasciitilde}2.5\%.},

  abstract = {Chemical etching and Al2O3 dielectric passivation were used to minimize nonradiative sidewall defects in InGaN/GaN microLEDs (mesa diameter = 2–100 μm), resulting in an increase in external quantum efficiency (EQE) as the LED size was decreased. Peak EQEs increased from 8\%–10\% to 12\%–13.5\% for mesa diameters from 100 μm to 2 μm, respectively, and no measurable leakage currents were seen in current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. The position and shape of EQE curves for all devices were essentially identical, indicating size-independent ABC model (Shockley–Read–Hall, radiative, and Auger recombination) coefficients-behavior that is not typical of microLEDs as the size decreases. These trends can be explained by enhancement in light extraction efficiency (LEE), which is only observable when sidewall defects are minimized, for the smallest LED sizes. Detailed ray-tracing simulations substantiate the LEE enhancements.},

  title    = {Emerging challenges and considerations when characterizing μ{LEDs}},
  abstract = {Soon after the initial development of III-Nitride blue LEDs, researchers quickly developed and
              standardized characterization methods to better understand and improve device performance. Research
              concentrated on increasing light output and EQE (external quantum efficiency) of LED chips, often with
              diameters near 1 mm; today, focus is shifting to new applications such as μLED (microLED) display
              technology, where LED sizes are reduced to the order of 1 μm.
              Characterizing μLEDs requires developing new standards, tools, and methods to properly
              characterize the devices. This is partly due to differences in application from solid-state lighting (SSL).
              Whereas LEDs for SSL are traditionally packaged (to maximize total output) and measured in integrating
              spheres, μLEDs should be measured “on-chip” to mimic their real-world usage. “On-chip” measurements
              introduce new variables and sources of error which must be considered (such as the collection angle).
              Additionally, reducing sizes of μLEDs causes proportionate decreases in test parameters (including
              driving current and output power) which necessitate more sensitive instrumentation and careful
              calibrations. In order meet these requirements while accommodating the many possible μLED device
              variations (of different wavelengths, substrates, sizes etc) being researched, it was necessary to construct
              a test station from the ground up.},
